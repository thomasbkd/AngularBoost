    is a powerful library for reactive programming using observables.
    It allows developers to work with asynchronous data streams such as events, HTTP requests, or user inputs in a
    declarative and composable way. Instead of manually managing callbacks or promises, RxJS provides a rich set of
    operators to transform, filter, combine, and control the flow of data over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the heart of RxJS is the <span class="keyword">Observable</span>, which represents a stream of data that can be
    observed and reacted to. Observables can emit multiple values over time, and subscribers can respond to these
    emissions using functions like <i>next</i>, <i>error</i>, and <i>complete</i>.
    RxJS also includes Subjects, which act as both observables and observers, making them useful for multicasting and
    event handling.
  </p>

  <p>
    RxJS is deeply integrated into Angular, especially in areas like HTTP requests, form controls, and component
    communication. By mastering RxJS, developers can write cleaner, more maintainable code that handles complex
    asynchronous logic with ease.
